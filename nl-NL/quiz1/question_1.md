You have used a lot of `if` statements to control your game's behaviour. Some of them might have had more complex conditions, using `and` to make multiple tests at once. If you ran the following piece of conditional code, what would you expect the output to be?

```python
score = 5000
levens = 2

if score >= 5000 and levens >= 3:
  print('Dat vliegt geweldig!')

if score >= 5000: 
  print('Je doet het goed!')
  if levens > 1:
    print('Ga door!')
  else:
    print('Maar wees voorzichtig!')

elif levens > 1:
  print('Harder werken!')

else:
  print('Ga naar de basis!')
```

While `score >= 5000` is true, for an `and` condtion both parts must be true, and `lives >= 3` is false.

Je doet het goed!
Ga door!

This is correct â€” `score >= 5000` is true, and so is `lives > 1` on the nested `if` statement.

Close, but `score >= 5000` isn't the only condition the program would find true as it ran.

While `lives > 1` is true, only the code inside the first true condition in an `if`/`elif`/`else` statement is executed, and `lives > 1` is not the first condition that is true.
