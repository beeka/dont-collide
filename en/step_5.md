## Speed up!

Most endless runner games increase the difficulty of the game as the player progresses, and give them a score. 

### Add difficulty levels
Creating clear difficulty levels will make it easier for your player to understand what is happening.

--- task ---

Create a `global` `level` variable to track the level the player is currently on. Set it to `1` so players start a new game on the first level.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
---
# Include global variables here
level = 1
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

This code uses the `height` and the `frame_count` to increase the `level` variable every time the player finishes a screen, then prints out the new level for the player.

**Choose:** This code limits the levels to five, so it doesn't get too hard to play. There's no reason your game has to use five, but you should choose a limit. Humans can only move so fast!

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py â€” draw_obstacles()
line_numbers: false
---
def draw_obstacles():
  
  global level #Use the global level
  
  if frame_count % height == height - 1 and level < 5:
    level += 1
    print('You have reached level', level)
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---


The two main options for increasing difficulty are to make the game move faster, and to increase the number of obstacles.

The speed of the game is controlled by how fast obstacles seem to be moving towards the player. This code speeds this up by adding `frame_count * level` to the `y` coordinate during obstacle generation.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py â€” draw_obstacles()
line_numbers: false
---
  for i in range(6):
    ob_x = randint(0, height)
    ob_y = randint(0, height) + (frame_count * level)
    ob_y %= height #Wrap around
    text('ðŸŒµ', ob_x, ob_y)
--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: Add more obstacles
---

Adding extra obstacles is just a matter of increasing the number of times the `for` loop that creates them runs. You can do this by increasing the number you pass to the `range()` function by `level`.

**Tip:** Of course, you can always use `level * 2`, or even larger multiples, if you want to make your game harder.

--- /task ---

### Keep score

The longer a player lasts without colliding with an obstacle, the better they're playing your game. Adding a score will let them see how well they're doing.

--- task ---

Create a global `score` variable to track the player's score. Set it to `0` so players start a new game without any points.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
---
# Include global variables here
score = 0
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You can increase your player's score for every frame where they have not collided with an obstacle by increasing their score when you check for collision in `draw_player()`.

**Choose:** You can decide how many points each frame is worth, but increasing the player's score by `level` rewards players who can survive at higher difficulty levels.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py â€” draw_player()
---
global score

  if collide == safe:
    text('ðŸŽˆ', mouse_x, player_y)
    score += level
  else:
    text('ðŸ’¥', mouse_x, player_y)
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Players should be able to see their score. Because it increases so quickly, using `print()` wouldn't work very well. Use the p5 `text()` function inside your `draw()` function, to display it as text on the game screen instead.

You can use the `+` operator to combine two or more strings if you want to give a heading like 'score' or 'points'.

--- /task ---

### Game over!

When a player has collided with an obstacle, the game should stop moving and their score should stop increasing.

--- task ---

You can use the `level` variable to signal 'Game over' by setting it to 0 â€” a value it will never reach any other way. Do this in the `else` step of your colision detection code.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create an `if` statement in `draw()` that tests whether `level > 0` before calling any of the functions â€” like `background()`, `draw_obstacles()`, and `draw_player()` â€” that update the game. Because these functions are not called, the entire game seems to end, even though your program is still running.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.
