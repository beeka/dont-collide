legend: Question 3 of 3
---

Your game is a big hit and someone has just published a video reviewing it. While they enjoyed it, they describe some changes they'd like to see. Which of the following is the best way to react to this?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Ignore it — they don't know what they're talking about!

  --- feedback ---
This isn't the ideal reaction — it's usually worth listening to what your users have to say about your work. They may have good suggestions, or point out issues you should do something about. Of course, you can always decide not to make changes after listening.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Do the exact opposite of what they suggest.

  --- feedback ---
This is probably a bad idea. You may not like what they have to say, but deciding to intetionally do the opposite of what user feedback suggests may lead to your game becoming less and less enjoyable for users.
  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Think about thier suggestions and compare them with what others have said.

  --- feedback ---
This is the best choice. It is good to listen to your users, and let their feedback guide improvements to the game, but you should always try to get multiple points of view before deciding on any significant changes.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Change the game in the exact way they suggest

  --- feedback ---
It is a good idea to listen to your users, but you shouldn't base updates to the game on the opinions of a single user, even if they do have a large platform.
